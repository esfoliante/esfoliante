If you are new here you might as well stay for a little search on my GitHub account.

I'm a teenager and a passionate self-taught backend and mobile developer from Portugal.
I would love to do something cute for my portfolio but I am not that good with design.

- 🚀 I’m currently working on an app to find vegan products
- 📚 I’m currently learning Operating Systems' (Kernel) development and C
- 💙 My favorite technology is Flutter
- 💬 Ask me about anything on my [Telegram](https://t.me/esfoliante)
- ⚡️ Fun fact: I started working at 16

<h3 style="color: #5094F0;">These are my GitHub Stats 👀</h3>

These stats don't show how often I work because I work mainly on repositories in other servers and also don't show the language I mainly code use, which is Dart.
